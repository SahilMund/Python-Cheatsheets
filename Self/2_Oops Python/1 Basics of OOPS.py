# intro to OOPS python

'''
1.One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. 
This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

2.Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

3.An object has two characteristics:

		a.	attributes
		b.	behavior
		
Let's take an example:-----

A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties:

	a.	name, age, color as attributes
	B.	singing, dancing as behavior
	
4.The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. 
	This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
	
5.It helps to implement real life application.

#? Key Points to Remember:-
Object-Oriented Programming makes the program easy to understand as well as efficient.

Since the class is sharable, the code can be reused.

Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.

Polymorphism allows the same interface for different objects, so programmers can write 
efficient code.
